Hello I m Haoqin Wei, and this is mt workout project1

This is my first workout project: a simple reverse cipher. 

Basically, the program takes a file and flips all its content backward. If you run the program on the same file twice, you'll get the original text back—it's symmetric like that.

To make sure the program doesn't crash on really huge files, I used the 'pathlib' module to find out exactly how many bytes the file has (using .stat().st_size). 

How to run:
python wp1.py <input_file> <output_file>
