Hello I am Haoqin Wei
This is my ics 32 assignment1 part1

This program is a simple command-line directory inspection tool. It repeatedly accepts user commands and supports L <directory> to list the contents of a directory and Q to quit.

For the L command, the program prints files first and then directories, sorted by name. 

It also supports optional flags such as -r for recursive listing, -f to show only files, -s <filename> to match a specific file name, and -e <extension> to match a file extension.

************ IMPORTANT ************
My previous folder was mistakenly created under my assignment0, and my full git log was there.

I finished all my code and copy everything into this freshnew folder.

That's why you can only see few git log.

If you want to check my full git log and working process

You can search me on github "Haoqin-Wei" -----> the folder of ics32.

Thanks!
